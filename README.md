# PyNFT-Gen
> PyNFT-Gen is a simple Python application built on top of Tkinter that provides UI-functionality to generate thousands
> of small images mostly seen on NFT markets. It does so by letting the user select multiple input-directories, which
> contain multiple .png-files for each layer. The application then stacks each layer on top of each other, generating
> a wide variety of NFT-pictures.
